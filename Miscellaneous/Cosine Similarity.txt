 Cosine Similarity between two texts can be computed as the cosine of the angle between the vectors.

cos(d1, d2) = (d1 · d2) / ||d1|| ||d2|| , 
where · indicates vector dot product, ||d|: the length of vector d

This means to find the Cosine Similarity, one has to
• Find the dot product of the vectors
• Determine the magnitude of vector 
• Determine the magnitude of vector 
• Multiply the magnitude of vector with magnitude of vector
• Divide the found dot product of the vectors by the products of the magnitudes of vector 
and vector 
Before going further it is best to mention that a vector is a geometric structure with both length aka magnitude
and direction. Mathematical operations like addition, multiplication, division can be done if and only if the
vectors being performed on have an equal number of dimensions.

There are two ways of storing the letters in the vectors; one is by occurrence and the other by frequency.
Storing only the occurrence of a letter in the vector it will result in a binary occurrence vector but storing the
frequency in which a letter occurs in the vector, it will result in a frequency of an occurrence vector.
